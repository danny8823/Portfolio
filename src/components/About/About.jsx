      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I come from a non-traditional background as a plumber. In the field of plumbing I fell in love with problem-solving. It was my duty to diagnose plumbing issues and provide solutions for customers.</p><br/>
      <p>
        I dove into the world of coding through freecodecamp and decided I wanted to take it a step further by attending school. I enrolled in Fullstack Academy and learned full-stack development. 
      </p><br/>
      <p>From there I never stopped learning, I am currently working as a Automation Support Specialist, where I am refinding my skills.</p><br/>
