      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I began my career in an unconventional way—working as a plumber. It was in this hands-on field that I developed a passion for problem-solving, diagnosing complex issues, and delivering effective solutions to customers.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>
      My interest in tackling challenges led me to explore coding through FreeCodeCamp. Eager to expand my knowledge, I enrolled at Fullstack Academy, where I gained a strong foundation in full-stack development.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
      Since then, my learning journey hasn’t stopped. I’m currently working as an Automation Support Specialist, where I continue to refine and expand my technical skills, always striving to stay ahead of the curve.
